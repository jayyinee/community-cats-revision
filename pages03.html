      <h2>The Solutions for Community Cats</h2>
        <p>There are community cats are over the world, and different cities/countries will have different solutions depending on the cities/countries’ environment and residents’ lifestyles. But for the aforementioned solutions, I will focus on how the New York City and Australia governments solve their problems with community cats as they are drastically different from each other.</p>

        <h2>New York City: Trap-Neuter-Return</h2>
          <p>A solution for overpopulation and safety for community cats is Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR). In the TNR programs, community cats will be humanly trapped with boxes traps; spayed (females) or neutered (males); vaccinated for rabies; their left ears will be eartipped (to indicate they have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated); and then they will be returned to their territory. The goal of TNR is to improve the quality of life for cats on the street and reduce the unnecessary killing of cats.</p>

        <h2>Australia: Euthanasia</h2>
          <p>In contrast, the Australian government rejects the Trap-Neuter-Return method because it doesn't work for the environment in Australia. Taking cares of stray cats can become a community health and safety issues as community cats can cause troubles for the welfare of house pets, wildlife and people. Furthermore, they want to put the cats down because they don't want the cats to suffer from:</p>
            <p>1. Injury (trauma from vehicle collisions & killed by other carnivore species)</p>
            <p>2. Ingestion of toxic compounds (rodenticide, pesticide, & poisonous plants)</p>
            <p>3. Poor health & body condition (excluded competitively from food sources, shorter life-spans, & higher juvenile mortality, exposed to parasite loads & diseases)</p>
            <p>4. Parasites & diseases, which are difficult and costly to treat</p>
            <p>5. No space to live & no food to eat</p>

          <h2 style="color: red">But can these solutions really solve the problems?!</h2>
            <p>As much as I agree with the reasons for these solutions, I think they are flawed in many ways. Firstly, the TNR method can be a stressful procedure for both well-socialized and unsocialized/partially socialized cats as they will be trapped using trap boxes, which most definitely will scare the cats. I can vividly imagine how they will screech as they are enclosed in a small space, carrying by a stranger to a strange place. As I also mentioned before, the TNR method does not guarantee that the cats will have a quality life. Secondly, as much as it might be necessary to euthanize cats to avoid problems they may cause, I think it’s completely inhuman of us to kill them. Afterall, they are still a living creature. We shouldn’t think of them any less just because it’s just an animal in comparison to us. Finally, if these solutions really work, why are stray cats and feral cats still an ongoing problem? I think we should really get to the bottom of this problem, which is educating people and imposing strict laws that will limit these unethical behaviors. Many people will adopt cats, thinking it is easy and cute to have a house pet. However, taking care of a pet is as much responsibility as taking care of a human. We still need to provide them food, take care of their hygiene, train them to have better behaviors, and even more. So when the owners realize it’s difficult to take care of the pets, the owners will abandon the pets instead of learning how to actually take care of them. And most importantly, there should be rules to limit the unethical breeding of “exotic” pets. The current trend of pet ownership nowadays is having cute, instagrammable or purebred pets. And to get these pets, you will need them to be bred a certain way. More often than not, they will not have the desirable physical traits so they will be thrown out, contributing to the overpopulation of stray pets. Furthermore, these animals usually have terrible health conditions such as breathing difficulty, hip dysplasia, and more, making it difficult for them to live a normal life.
