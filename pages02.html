        <h2>The Problems of Community Cats</h2>
          <p>Community cats are outdoor, unowned, and free-roaming cats. They can be divided into two categories: stray cats and feral cats. Stray cats are cats who have once lived indoors and were socialized to humans at some point. But then, they left or lost their home, or were abandoned by their owners, and no longer have regular contact with humans. Over time, stray cats can become feral cats, who are now unsocialized wild animals and typically aggressive towards humans and house pets. The main topics of these problems are overpopulation, safety, and nuisance behaviors of community cats.</p>

      <h2>Overpopulation</h2>
        <p>3.2 million cats are abandoned every year. They either enter animal shelters, or worse, dumped at random places. Because community cats are free-roaming animals, more likely than not, they will mate with cats of the opposite gender during mating seasons. Cats have an average of four to eight kittens per litter. These reasons have caused the population of community cats to increase tremendously in a short period of time. In the United States alone, there is estimated to be 30 to 40 million community cats. And across all 7 continents combined, the number of community cats is estimated to be 600 million. Overpopulation is also the number one cause of death of community cats. Every year, approximately 2 million cats are euthanized in shelters and animal control facilities nationwide due to the lack of space and adoption.</p>

      <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Mating seasons not only contribute to the overpopulation of community cats, they also put many female cats at risk. Female cats can get pregnant very young, as young as one year old. They can also have multiple litters in a year. It’s really hard on their bodies, they typically end up having a very short life and a lot of their kittens don’t make it. Depending on where they’ve been, a lot of the time, especially the kittens, they’ll have herpes in their eyes. They have bad eye infection where their eyeballs kind of popped out and are very swollen. It’s a very typical problem, they almost always have worms & fleas, and in general, nutrition is an issue, especially for nursing moms. These infections can then generate diseases and spread to other community cats or even house pets. Furthermore, it's common for community cats to be killed or injured by automobiles while roaming around, with an estimated 26 million cats per year.</p>

      <h2>Nuisance Behaviors</h2>
        <p>Some of the nuisance behaviors caused by community cats are:</p>
          <p>1. Digging into trash and residents' yard
          <p>2. Lounging around residents' propeties</p>
          <p style="white-space: nowrap">3. Damaging residents' properties—breaking fragile items, scratching cars, and destroying plants or flowers</p>
          <p>4. Urinating everywhere, which produces unpleasant smells</p>
          <p>5. Attracting wildlife</p>
          <p>6. Killing or injuring other animals—birds, and house pets</p>
